Weaknesses: Internal factors that are limitations, challenges, or areas in need of improvement. Identifying weaknesses helps in addressing and mitigating potential issues.

Opportunities: External factors that present possibilities for growth, development, or positive change. Recognizing opportunities helps in making the most of favorable conditions.

Challenges: External factors that pose potential threats or obstacles. Identifying challenges allows for proactive planning and risk management.

Identify Objectives: Clearly define the specific objectives or goals you want to analyze.

Collect Data: Gather information about internal and external factors relevant to your objectives. Use techniques like brainstorming, surveys, and research.

Categorize Data: Organize the collected data into the four categories: Strengths, Weaknesses, Opportunities, and Challenges.

Prioritize: Assess the significance of each item within these categories. Focus on the most critical factors.

Develop Strategies: Based on your analysis, create strategies to capitalize on strengths, address weaknesses, leverage opportunities, and mitigate challenges.
